Access to a telephone is needed for the testing of this application. Alternatively, You can use our "Call-us-now" button on our website (http://m2rtin.github.io/alex-site).

We have currently 3 machines deployed for serving telephone lines and 1 for serving the button. So there is a possibility, that the button will not be always available.

Before You proceed, please make sure You are in a quiet place if possible, with disturbing elements (TV, Radio) off. If You decide to use the website button, please use headphones, for the system may pick up the speaker-microphone echo which causes the system to misbehave. Also make sure You have a working microphone on Your device.

NOTE: We are currently in the process of collecting data for training our new acoustic/language model. This means that we do not have excellent voice recognition capabilities particularly in noisy places. This issue will be eliminated by introducing the new model.

Now, either call "1-631-832-1179" or click a "Call-us-Now" button on our website.
